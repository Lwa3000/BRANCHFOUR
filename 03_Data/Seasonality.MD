**BART ridership Seasonality**

- Pull total ridership by week for 2016 and 2017
- Linear Graph depicting YOY:
    - Highlight most significant peaks and valleys and find significant events/holidays associated with them
- DF showing month over month / week over week builds
- Hypothesis: Highest peak for 2016 and 2017 would have been Superbowl week (Superbowl in SF February 7th). This would be considered an outlier.
